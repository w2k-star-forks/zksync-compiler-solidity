# Solidity

The compiler from Solidity to zkEVM.

## View only

This repository is public, but the compiler cannot yet be built from source.

Please use the tools that have been offically released by Matter Labs.

## Usage

Check `zksolc --help` for the compiler usage.

> The version `<=0.8.17` of Solidity compiler must be available in `PATH`, or the `--solc` option must be used instead.

> Do not use the former patches of *solc*, as each version introduces important bug fixes!
